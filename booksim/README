To use the simulator, first MAKE it.  It works with the leland
(/usr/pubsw/bin) tools, but should also be easily compiled with any
GCC 2.X installation (GCC 3.X is another story).  I've also compiled
the code under Visual Studio.

To run the simulator, simply type

  booksim <config>

where <config> is a configuration file.  Two example files are
included: 

  islip8_config -- a single node simulation designed to stress the
    switch allocator.

  mesh88_age_config -- an 8x8 mesh with age-based arbitration.

Comments on the simulation parameters are included in each of these
configuration files.  All possible paramters are contained in
booksim_config.cpp.

The basic router currently supported by the simulator is an
input-queued, virtual-channel router.  Both k-ary n-cube and k-ary
n-fly topologies along with several routing algorithms and traffic
patterns are also supported.
