The virtual simulator created by Bill Dally was extended by Hiro Aoki to 
include k-ary n-cubes and some adaptive routing functions.

The code is being distributed for use in EE482B.  This code does not
currently compile.  We are providing it so that you may possibly take
the k-ary n-cube module for use in your extension of the original
simulator.
